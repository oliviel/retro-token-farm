# Retro Token Farm DEFI Project

This project was made with:

- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Ness.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/)

### Steps to run the project

1. Install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

2. Compile the contracts.

```
npx hardhat compile 
```

3. Test the contracts.

```
npx hardhat test 
```

4. Create a second account in [metamask](https://metamask.io/) if you don't have one and use the second account (metamask is an extension to do blockchain transactions in the browser, if you don't metamask installed click the metamask link to install the extension)

   ![account-2](https://i.ibb.co/d79tRdk/account-2.png)

5. Create a `.env` file and add the 12 MNEMONIC phrase generated by metamask look at the `.env.example` file to have an example (this step will connect your HD WALLET in this case metamask with the test hardhat accounts while you are in the hardhat network)

6. Run the hardhat network (this command will run the hardhat network with 10 test accounts with 1000 fake ETH for each one)

```
npx hardhat node
```

7. Open a new terminal while the hardhat network is running and run the next script (this script  will deploy the contracts to the hardhat network and will create the `abis` folder inside `./src`)

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost 
```

8. Change metamask to the hardhat network if you don't have the hardhat network added follow the next steps of the image.

   ![network-data](https://i.ibb.co/CJjHnK2/network-data.png)
9.  Add the Mock Dai Token to metamask in custom Tokens.
    ![add-token](https://i.ibb.co/2cN2yhy/add-token.png)
    ![custom-token](https://i.ibb.co/nkwz0VD/custom-token.png)
    If you don't know the mock dai contract address check inside the ``./src/abis`` inside the file ``daitoken-address.json`` you will find the address. (Note to create the abis folder you need to do step 5) if you don't know the token symbol and decimals check inside the ``./contracts/DaiToken.sol`` contract
10.  Run the react app.

```
npm start
```

11. Start playing with the token farm stacking and unstacking tokens.

```
npx hardhat run scripts/issue-tokens.js --network localhost 
```
