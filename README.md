    ![custom-token](https://i.ibb.co/nkwz0VD/custom-token.png)
    If you don't know the mock dai contract address check inside the ``./src/abis`` inside the file ``daitoken-address.json`` you will find the address. (Note to create the abis folder you need to do step 5) if you don't know the token symbol and decimals check inside the ``./contracts/DaiToken.sol`` contract
10. Run the react app.

```
npm start
```

11. Start playing with the token farm stacking and unstacking tokens.
12. Issue Retro tokens to your address.

```
npx hardhat run scripts/issue-tokens.js --network localhost 
```
